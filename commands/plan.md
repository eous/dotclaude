$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Do NOT write any code yet**
2. Use the `planner` agent to analyze the task
3. Explore the codebase to understand context
4. Design an implementation approach
5. Create a structured plan with clear steps
6. Present the plan for approval before implementation

## Process

1. First, invoke the planner agent with the task description
2. The planner will investigate the codebase and design an approach
3. Review the plan and ask clarifying questions if needed
4. Once approved, proceed to implementation with `/implement`
