# Implementation Phase

You are entering **implementation mode** for:

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Follow the existing plan (if one exists)
2. Use the `implementer` agent for writing code
3. Make incremental, testable changes
4. Run tests after each significant change
5. Mark progress as you complete steps

## Process

1. Review any existing plan in context
2. If no plan exists, consider running `/plan` first
3. Implement changes step by step
4. Verify each change works before proceeding
5. After completion, consider running `/review`

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Follows existing code patterns
- [ ] Includes appropriate error handling
- [ ] Has necessary type annotations
- [ ] Tests pass after changes
- [ ] No unrelated changes included

Begin implementation now.
